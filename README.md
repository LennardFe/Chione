<h1 align="center">ðŸ”® Chione</h1>
<p align="center">Python-based autoclicker and macro tool designed primarily for the videogame Minecraft.</p>

---

<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

<div align="justify">
<p>Simple tool for autoclicking and basic macro assistance. It bypasses all well-known clients, functions on any Minecraft version, and remains undetected by major servers. Features include Left- and Right-Click, Auto-Sprint, W-Tap, Strafing, Anti-AFK, and Self-Destruct. Settings allow modules to halt in menus and activate only when Minecraft is in the foreground.</p>

<h2 align="center">Installation</h2>

<div align="justify">
<p>Install Python 3.11.5, ensuring compatibility with the project requirements. Start by navigating to the GitHub page of this project. Locate the green Code button on the top right and click it. You can either clone it using the command prompt with git clone followed by the shown URL, download the zip file, or open it directly with GitHub Desktop. After that navigate to the project folder and continue with the next step.</p>
</div>

<div align="justify">
<p>After setting up Python and having downloaded the project, I would recommend setting up a virtual environment to isolate the project and its packages, to avoid interference with a possible global Python installation. To do that, you can use the following command on any system:</p>
</div>

```
python -m venv .venv
```

<div align="justify">
<p>This will create a new folder called <i>.venv</i> containing the virtual environment. Run the next command to activate the created environment. After running this, you should see the virtual environment's name (.venv) show up in the command prompt.</p>
</div>

```
.venv\Scripts\Activate
```

<div align="justify">
<p>As the last step, install the required packages with the following command:</p>
</div>

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<div align="justify">
<p>You should now be ready to execute the program, navigate to the <i>main.py</i> file and execute it. Chione should open itself. In future releases an .exe file will be provided.</p>
